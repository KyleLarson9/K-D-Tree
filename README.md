Description

This is a demonstration of a k-d tree in Java which is used to find the closest point to an object in 2 dimensional space.

Features

  1. Data Storage: An array list of points and a tree used to construct the kd tree.
  2. Java Swing: Used to develop the Graphical User Interface and game components.

Why I Developed the Project

I developed this project because I wanted to understand more about tree data structures and what they can be used for. While working on a Light Refraction Simulation project, I encountered a problem that required quickly identifying the nearest points/polygons to a light ray. Additionally, I decided to use this project to make my collision detection project more efficient.

What I Learned

In this project, I learned more about the tree data structure, specifically a binary tree. I worked on implementing better coding practices I knew in my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
